Shrey J. Patel(2019CS10400) - Analytic Tableau

This submission consists of the following files:

1) flasl2ast.lex => ML-Lex specification for the scanning of tokens
2) flasl2ast.yacc => ML-Yacc specification for the parsing of tokens
3) AST.sml => AST specification for the given language i.e. FLASL
4) flasl2ast.sml => SML file to convert FLASL text to the corresponding Abstract Syntax Tree of Argument type
5) ast2flasl.sml => SML file which takes an AST of argument type to obtain a FLASL text file
6) binder.sml => Glue Code to link all the above files
7) loader.sml => To load all the above files and dependencies
8) Makefile => To build and run all the required files
9) proptableau.sml => SML code for checking logical validity usign Analytic Tableau

--How to run the files?

1) All the files can be built by using the Makefile by typing `make all` in the command line. 
2) This will open the SML interactive environment. 
3) To run the parser, type in the console `runParser <input_flasl_file>`, and this will return an AST.
4) To check the logical validity of a given FLASL argument, type `check <input_flasl_file> <output_file>` to generate the result in an output file.
   If the given argument is valid, then output will show "Valid!" and otherwise, it will print "Invalid!" along with a falsifying assumption.
